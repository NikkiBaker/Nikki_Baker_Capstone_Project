   <strong>
    <ul>1. Why preserve your older analog memories? </ul>
    <ul>Your memories are priceless, and irreplaceable. Your family probably has THOUSANDS of home movies and photos in multiple formats. The benefit of preserving your memories is twofold: first, by keeping a copy of your family videos and photos on DVD or Blu-ray or USB drive and in the cloud, you preserve these memories forever. Second, modern technologies allow you to enjoy your digital videos and photos in many more ways than traditional analog home movies and photos. With your memories in a modern digital format, you will be able to effortlessly organize, label, and share your memories library. In addition, you can easily create personalized memories gifts -- like video montages and photo books - for special occasions.</ul><br>
    <ul>2. What is a ''digizitization''? </ul>
    <ul>Digital format refers to the transfer of your media from an out of date format to a digital file that you view online, download and share using a computer or device. It is also the first step in transferring you media to a DVD. </ul> <br>
    <ul>3. Can I put multiple tapes on a DVD? </ul>
